The CA project for CCT Dublin collegue.
According to this assignment, I was tasked to model and create a working programme to demonstrate "Company" as a prototype. I chose Tech Company. The user interacts with the programme through a console menu. HR personnel or department manager can represent the Operator of “Tech Company” programme. The programme contains five main classes to interact: Company, Department, Manager, Developer, and Office Employee.

Terminal Menu Examples: The user will be required to select from a number of options from the menu, use
Enums for the Menu to iterate through the options available from the list below, this is required for all
sections: Sort a Dummy List of People, Search in the List and Return Relevant Information, Allow for New
User Input (Name, ManagervChoice, and Department), Generate Random People with Manager Types
and Departments.

Sort a Dummy List of People: You will have a list of random names in a file called Applicants_Form.txt
gathered from the form submissions of interested applicants to the Company; this list should be sorted in
alphabetical order. The output of the sort should be displayed on the screen [show the first 20 records
only]. The sorting of the list will ensure that the data is organised and can be efficiently searched and
updated.
You will need to select an appropriate RECURSIVE sorting algorithm AND provide a clear explanation for
why you chose this algorithm and not an alternative. Do not provide definitions of the algorithm's function.

Search in the List and Return Relevant Information: The program should be able to search for people by
name from the list and return information related to their Manager type and Department name.
You will need to select an appropriate searching algorithm AND provide a clear explanation for why you
chose this algorithm and not an alternative.

Allow for New User Input (Name, Manager Choice, and Department): The program should be interactive,
enabling users to input new data. Users should be able to input a name, choose a Manager type, and select
a Department for that person. This data should then be added to the list and appropriately stored in the
program's memory. It's essential to validate user inputs to ensure that the Manager type and Department
selected actually exist and list all the new entries in the terminal.

Generate Random People with Coach Types and Teams: In this step, you will have to create a mechanism
for generating random individuals and assigning them a Manager type and Department. This could be used
for testing and populating the system with initial data. You will need to ensure that the randomly generated
data doesn't conflict with existing Manager types and Departments and list all the Employees in the
terminal.

Enums for the Menu: Use enums to define the various menu options, making the user interface more
structured and easier to manage.
