    /**
     * Reads data from a specified file and returns a list of `Person` objects.
     * <p>
     * The `readFile` method prompts the user for a file name and reads data from that file to create
     * an `ArrayList` of `Person` objects. This method is designed to provide a structured way of
     * importing employee or applicant data, which is especially useful for companies looking to
     * integrate bulk data management into their application. By centralizing the file reading process
     * in this class, the program achieves a single point of data input, making future updates to file
     * handling simpler and more efficient. Additionally, it ensures that data is read, parsed, and
     * formatted consistently, which is critical for maintaining data integrity across the application.
     * <p>
     * Use Cases:
     * - **HR Staff**: This method can be valuable for HR staff or administrative users who need to
     * import a list of applicants or employees from external sources. For example, after a recruitment
     * drive, data from applicants could be saved to a text file and then uploaded to the system
     * without manual data entry.
     * - **IT Department**: IT staff responsible for maintaining employee databases may also use this
     * method for bulk uploads, helping to streamline onboarding or periodic data updates.
     * <p>
     * Importance:
     * - This class plays an essential role in the programâ€™s architecture by enabling automated data import.
     * - Reduces the potential for manual errors and ensures that large datasets can be quickly added to the
     * system, enhancing both speed and reliability in data management.
     * - The `Reader` class is designed to handle common file input challenges such as missing or
     * improperly formatted data, improving program robustness and user experience.
     *
     * @return ArrayList of `Person` objects containing data read from the file.
