/**
 * OfficeEmployee represents an employee working in within the company.
 *
 * This class extends the `Employee` class and adds a `title` field, specific to office employees,
 * to denote the job title of the employee within the office. Job title is an absolutely custom property.
 * We consider the user to know what kind of job titles for the company he or she needs.
 * It's the user's responsibility to create them in the way the user wants them to be,
 * because the user only knows what kind of job titles can exist within the company.
 * Examples include "Clerk" or "Desk Jockey". They are used for generating method.
 * The created variates are general and vague to give an opportunity to generate any employee to any department.
 * The `OfficeEmployee` class is designed to support scenarios where specific titles are needed for
 * categorizing office employees, helping to organize employee data more effectively.
 *
 * OfficeEmployee provides functionality for generating random office employee instances, which is useful
 * in testing environments or when building initial data sets. This class is also designed to print
 * formatted employee details, enhancing the usability of employee data displays in user interfaces.
